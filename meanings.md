`reports`: The root element representing the whole dataset. It contains 48 report element.

`report`: It is a single evaluation program with name and totalTime attributes indicating its name identifier and pure running time. One report consists of several data races marked as race element. 

`race`: This element represents a pair of data races. Each race element contains several other elements.

`line1`: One line number of a pair of data race

`line2`: The other line number of a pair of data race

`variable`: The variable name which data race occurs in.

`packageClass`: The package and class name which data race occurs in.

`detail`: Information about call stack causing data race.

`runningTime`: Temporarily not be used. For future expansion.

`variableType`: We referred to the Java data type, combined with data race, then divided the variable type into four categories: primitive types, reference types, collection types and mixed usage.

`codeStructure`: Taking into account the control ï¬‚ow structure of Java program language, the following code structures are related to data race: basic statements, branch conditions, statements in branch, loop conditions and statements in loop.

`methodSpan`: We divide the race locations into three categories: the same method of the same class, different methods of the same class, different methods of different classes.

`sensitiveBranch`: It record whether this pair of data race is a schedule-sensitive branch.

`sensitiveLoop`: Temporarily not be used. For future expansion.

`cause`: In term of synchronization operations, we can divide them into three categories: no synchronization, partial synchronization and incorrect synchronization.

`commonUsage`: It contains some common and typical usage habits causing data race.

`bug`: Temporarily not be used. For future expansion.
